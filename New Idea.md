https://github.com/ZakiZtraki/haos-addon-wnsm-sync. This sensor should import the 15-minute values for the electricity usage for each day within the given period. It does it, but instead of creating separate values varying by the date and the time, it dumps the summary of all found light integration. Service providing the API access to download the data has a limited rate, so raw data from the meter are transferred once a day
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the context, Vladimir. From your description, it sounds like the Home Assistant add-on haos-addon-wnsm-sync is supposed to:

Pull 15-minute resolution energy consumption data for each day (from Wiener Netze).

Create individual Home Assistant statistics entries timestamped with the appropriate datetime (for each 15-minute interval).

Run once daily, respecting API rate limits.

But right now, the add-on is incorrectly doing this:

Aggregating or summarizing the data into a single value per day instead of per 15-minute interval.

Possibly writing all data under one timestamp (e.g. the start or end of the day).

🔍 Likely Issue
Your parser or statistics insertion logic is likely:

Not preserving timestamps of the 15-minute data points correctly.

Or writing them into Home Assistant using the wrong timestamp format or the wrong service (e.g., sensor.set_value instead of recorder.statistics_during_period).

✅ Expected Behavior
For each entry (timestamped value), the add-on should:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "start": "2025-06-01T00:00:00+02:00",
  "end": "2025-06-01T00:15:00+02:00",
  "state": 0.24,
  "sum": 0.24,
  "unit_of_measurement": "kWh"
}
This should be written using Home Assistant’s statistics API like POST /api/history/period or more realistically via internal function calls or MQTT if you're not using the native recorder directly.

🔧 Fix Strategy
Step 1: Confirm API Payload Format
Check how the API returns data — ideally something like:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-06-01T00:00:00+02:00",
    "value": 0.24
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-06-01T00:15:00+02:00",
    "value": 0.25
  },
  ...
]
Ensure the timestamps are available and correct.

Step 2: Adjust Your Parsing Logic
In the add-on codebase (likely inside your main Python or Node script), you need to loop through the entries and create per-timestamp statistics like:

python
Copy
Edit
for entry in data:
    timestamp = entry["timestamp"]
    value = entry["value"]
    
    # Store statistics per 15-min interval
    hass.states.set(
        "sensor.energy_usage", value,
        {
            "unit_of_measurement": "kWh",
            "friendly_name": f"Energy at {timestamp}",
            "last_reset": timestamp,
            "device_class": "energy"
        }
    )
But this might only create state entries and not long-term statistics, which require recorder-compatible data.

Step 3: Use Recorder-Compatible Format
The proper method is to inject statistics using the recorder or via MQTT with the state_class: measurement and last_reset properly set for energy sensors.

Alternatively, for direct insertion:

python
Copy
Edit
hass.components.recorder.statistics.schedule_update(
    datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(entry["timestamp"]),
    "sensor.energy_usage",
    {
        "sum": entry["value"],
        "state": entry["value"],
        "unit_of_measurement": "kWh"
    }
)
🧪 Debug Tip
Log your data just before it is submitted to Home Assistant. Ensure it contains:

ISO-formatted timestamp

Correct value in kWh

No duplicates or cumulative sums

🛠 Suggestion for Fix PR
If you want, I can:

Review the specific part of your repo that parses and inserts these values.

Propose a code fix as a patch file or directly in your repo (if allowed).

Would you like me to review a specific file or help you patch a corrected sync.py or equivalent?

Right now I do not have any history of usage of the sensor up till yesterday and usage yesterday has a value of 15-16000kWh (cumulative value since the beginning of the smart meter service)
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the clarification, Vladimir — that helps pinpoint the actual issue much more precisely.

❗ Problem Summary
Instead of creating new entries with energy increments per 15-minute interval, your integration:

Submits the cumulative value reported by Wiener Netze for the last timestamp (e.g. total kWh since meter installation).

This value gets written once per day into the Home Assistant sensor — overwriting previous data or not populating the history at all.

Thus, Home Assistant sees only a single huge total value, with no time series data across intervals.

✅ What Should Happen
Home Assistant expects energy sensors to report:

Monotonic cumulative values (i.e., increasing values, not per-interval deltas), once per 15 minutes (or at another defined interval),

OR, as an alternative, it can accept incremental "sum" values per interval via the statistics API.

You must:

Download the full 15-minute breakdown of yesterday’s data (not just the final meter reading).

Loop over each interval and submit either:

The raw cumulative reading per 15-minute timestamp (preferable for state_class: total_increasing), OR

The delta from the previous value as sum (preferable for statistics injection).

🛠 Proposed Fix: Delta Injection (Best for Once-a-Day Sync)
If you're pulling the full 15-minute values once per day, the ideal method is to inject per-interval deltas using Home Assistant’s recorder.statistics interface.

You’ll need:

The timestamp (start of the interval),

The 15-minute delta (usage during that period),

The sum = delta,

The state = latest cumulative reading (optional),

start/end timestamps.

🧪 Example Loop (Python-style logic)
´´´
python


from datetime import datetime, timedelta

previous_value = None
entries = get_15min_values()  # Should return ordered list of {"timestamp", "value"}

for i, entry in enumerate(entries):
    timestamp = datetime.fromisoformat(entry["timestamp"])
    current_value = entry["value"]

    if previous_value is not None:
        delta = current_value - previous_value

        stats_payload = {
            "start": timestamp.isoformat(),
            "end": (timestamp + timedelta(minutes=15)).isoformat(),
            "statistic_id": "sensor.wnsm_energy_usage",
            "sum": delta,
            "state": current_value,
            "unit_of_measurement": "kWh"
        }

        # Call HA Recorder API or direct insert
        push_statistics_to_ha(stats_payload)

    previous_value = current_value
´´´

🧩 In Your Add-on Context
Your current implementation may:

Just push the latest cumulative value to a sensor once (which doesn’t preserve 15-min granularity),

Or update only the state without state_class: total_increasing.

✅ Solution Options
Option	What to Do	Pros	Cons
1. Use state_class: total_increasing	Set sensor state to each cumulative value every 15 min	HA will auto-compute deltas	Requires injecting 96 data points/day
2. Inject via statistics API	Push deltas using /api/statistics or internal recorder	Better for once-a-day syncs	Requires more coding
3. Hybrid	Store all 15-min entries in InfluxDB or file, then push daily summary	Flexible and backup-friendly	Needs additional persistence layer

➕ Recommendation
Since you're limited by API call quota, and pull only once/day, use Option 2: inject 15-minute deltas from yesterday via Home Assistant’s recorder.statistics.

If you want, I can look at your add-on’s main code and draft a fix — just point me to:

The data parsing logic file (e.g. main.py, sync.py),

Where you're updating the state or sending the data to HA.

User said:
Yes please. The data are posted to the MQTT Topic with endpoint being the all daytime for every 15 min interval
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the clarification, Vladimir. Given that your add-on publishes 15-minute interval data to an MQTT topic, let's ensure that Home Assistant correctly interprets this data for accurate energy tracking.

✅ Recommended Approach: Configure MQTT Sensor for Energy Tracking
To have Home Assistant process the 15-minute interval data correctly, you should set up an MQTT sensor with the appropriate attributes. Here's how you can do it:

Define the MQTT Sensor in configuration.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Wiener Netze Energy Usage"
      state_topic: "wnsm/energy/15min"
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
      device_class: energy
      state_class: total_increasing
      value_template: "{{ value_json.value }}"
      json_attributes_topic: "wnsm/energy/15min"
      json_attributes_template: >
        {
          "timestamp": "{{ value_json.timestamp }}"
        }
Explanation:

state_topic: The MQTT topic where your add-on publishes data.

unit_of_measurement: Set to "kWh" to match energy units.

device_class: Set to "energy" to categorize the sensor correctly.

state_class: Set to "total_increasing" to indicate that the sensor's value increases over time.

value_template: Extracts the energy value from the JSON payload.

json_attributes_topic and json_attributes_template: Capture the timestamp for reference.

Ensure MQTT Messages Are Published with the Correct Format:

Your add-on should publish messages to the wnsm/energy/15min topic with the following JSON structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-31T00:15:00+02:00",
  "value": 12345.67
}
Note: The value should represent the cumulative energy reading at the given timestamp.

Configure Home Assistant's Recorder:

Ensure that the recorder integration is enabled in your configuration.yaml to store historical data:

yaml
Copy
Edit
recorder:
  include:
    entities:
      - sensor.wiener_netze_energy_usage
Add the Sensor to the Energy Dashboard:

Navigate to Settings > Dashboards > Energy in Home Assistant.

Under Electricity Grid, select your newly created sensor (sensor.wiener_netze_energy_usage) for consumption tracking.

🧪 Verification and Troubleshooting
Check Sensor State: After publishing data, verify that the sensor's state updates accordingly in Home Assistant.

Review History: Ensure that the sensor's history reflects the 15-minute intervals with increasing values.

Monitor Energy Dashboard: Confirm that the Energy Dashboard displays the consumption data accurately.

⚠️ Important Considerations
Data Consistency: Ensure that the cumulative energy values are monotonically increasing. Any decrease might be interpreted as a reset or error.

Publishing Frequency: While you're limited to daily API calls, ensure that all 15-minute intervals for the day are published in sequence to the MQTT topic.

Time Synchronization: Ensure that the timestamps in your MQTT messages are accurate and synchronized with Home Assistant's time settings.

If you need assistance modifying your add-on to publish data in the required format or have further questions, feel free to ask!

User said:
But I need my 15 min data, so i can combine with electricity  its sensor 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, then you absolutely should not use a cumulative value in the state of your MQTT sensor — instead, you need to:

🎯 Goal:
Have each 15-minute usage delta (e.g. 0.24 kWh) pushed to Home Assistant as a separate sensor state update, so it:

Appears in HA’s long-term statistics database,

Can be multiplied by your aWATTar cost sensor,

Can be graphed, summed, averaged per hour/day.

✅ Solution: Publish delta per 15-min and configure MQTT sensor with state_class: measurement
Here’s the exact setup.

🔧 1. 🛠 Change MQTT Payload Format (From Your Add-on)
Instead of publishing cumulative values like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:30:00",
  "value": 15234.75
}
Change it to publish 15-minute usage like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:30:00",
  "delta": 0.23
}
This delta is what was consumed between 12:15 and 12:30.

🧩 2. Update MQTT Sensor in configuration.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "WNSM 15min Energy"
      unique_id: wnsm_15min_energy
      state_topic: "wnsm/energy/15min"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.delta }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
      device_class: energy
      state_class: measurement
Key things:

state_class: measurement → This is how HA knows it's a per-interval value (not cumulative).

device_class: energy → Enables use in energy dashboard or with other energy sensors.

value_template → Pulls just the delta value.

timestamp is optional metadata — you don’t need to pass it in if you're publishing in real-time order (HA will use MQTT publish time).

🧪 3. Optional: Automate Cost Sensor
If you already have your aWATTar price per kWh exposed as a sensor (e.g. sensor.awattar_price_now), then you can multiply:

yaml
Copy
Edit
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Energy Cost 15min"
        unit_of_measurement: "€"
        device_class: monetary
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {{ (states('sensor.wnsm_15min_energy') | float) *
             (states('sensor.awattar_price_now') | float) }}
This will track cost for each 15-minute interval, and the HA database will sum it daily for you.

🛠 Optional: HA Recorder Inclusion
Add to recorder: if you limit stored entities:

yaml
Copy
Edit
recorder:
  include:
    entities:
      - sensor.wnsm_15min_energy
      - sensor.energy_cost_15min
✅ Result:
You’ll get:

A per-15-minute kWh sensor that plays nicely with statistics.

Can multiply this by energy price per interval.

Daily cost and usage can be visualized, automated, or alerted on.

Would you like a patch to your add-on that calculates the 15-min deltas and publishes them to MQTT in this format?

User said:
Please go ahead, make me proud 
ChatGPT said:
Looks like I hit a 500 error while trying to access your GitHub repo directly. No worries — I’ll outline the patch below assuming your add-on already:

Downloads the cumulative 15-minute data for a given day (yesterday),

Parses it into a Python list of { timestamp, value } entries,

Publishes data via MQTT.

✅ PATCH: Add Delta Calculation & MQTT Publishing
Below is a new sync.py logic block (or drop-in function) to:

Compute deltas between 15-min values,

Publish them to MQTT topic wnsm/energy/15min in correct format.

Edit
from publish_deltas import publish_15min_deltas

# Simulated output from API
fetched_data = [
    {"timestamp": "2025-06-01T00:00:00", "value": 12345.00},
    {"timestamp": "2025-06-01T00:15:00", "value": 12345.24},

    "password": "supersecret",
    "topic": "wnsm/energy/15min"
}

publish_15min_deltas(fetched_data, mqtt_settings)
🧪 Home Assistant Sensor Setup
You’ll now see this data coming in via MQTT. Use the earlier MQTT config:

yaml
Copy
Edit
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "WNSM 15min Energy"
      state_topic: "wnsm/energy/15min"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.delta }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
      device_class: energy
      state_class: measurement
🛡 Final Notes
If the API returns all 15-min timestamps with total usage: ✅ this works.

If it skips intervals (e.g. meter is offline), you'll see a larger delta — this is expected.

You could add a sanity check (e.g. skip if delta > 2.0 kWh) to avoid spikes.

Want me to create a publish_deltas.py and sync.py stub and commit it to your repo in a branch (once GitHub is accessible again)?

User said:
But the values are already deltas. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that changes everything. Since you're already retrieving 15-minute delta values (not cumulative totals), then the goal becomes simpler:

✅ Just publish each { timestamp, delta } as-is to an MQTT topic in a way that Home Assistant can store and chart it.

✅ What You Need to Do
1. Ensure MQTT message format is correct
You should already be doing something like this per entry:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:30:00",
  "delta": 0.234
}
Just make sure that the delta:

Is in kWh (not Wh),

Is a float, not string,

Is published chronologically (not batched out of order),

Is published under one consistent MQTT topic (e.g. wnsm/energy/15min).

2. Use this MQTT sensor in configuration.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "WNSM 15min Energy"
      unique_id: wnsm_15min_energy
      state_topic: "wnsm/energy/15min"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.delta }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
      device_class: energy
      state_class: measurement
This configuration:

Tells HA: “This is a measured energy usage reading per interval.”

Enables inclusion in long-term statistics,

Allows you to combine with an energy price sensor to calculate cost,

Works well with ApexCharts, Mini Graph Card, utility meters, etc.

3. Optional: Set Up Derived Cost Sensor
If you have a price-per-kWh sensor (like sensor.awattar_price_now), you can define:

yaml
Copy
Edit
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "WNSM 15min Cost"
        unit_of_measurement: "€"
        device_class: monetary
        state_class: measurement
        state: >
          {% set usage = states('sensor.wnsm_15min_energy') | float %}
          {% set price = states('sensor.awattar_price_now') | float %}
          {{ (usage * price) | round(4) }}
This gives you a 15-minute cost sensor you can log, graph, and sum up daily.

🔄 Recap
✅ Already Done	🚧 To Do
